<p>We're working on producing a new version of the PhoneGap video (replacing <a href="http://blip.tv/file/1850261/">this one</a>). We're hoping to include short video clips-a montage really-from a bunch of apps built with PhoneGap.</p>

<p>If you'd like your app included, please send it to Darren at <em>darren at capulet dot com</em>.</p>
