<p>In 2009, we taught in-person PhoneGap training sessions in San Francisco, Vancouver and New York. We also heard from PhoneGap users who couldn't attend our classes and wanted an online alternative.</p>

<p>We're happy to oblige-we've scheduled two online PhoneGap webinars for later this month. We're offering an introductory session and an advanced class. Each course is three hours in duration and will be taught by the Nitobi developers who created PhoneGap. Here are the details:</p>

<h2>Mobile App Development with PhoneGap - Introductory Course</h2>

<p>In this hands-on tutorial you'll discover how to use your HTML/JavaScript skills to build applications for mobile platforms including iPhone, Google Android, Blackberry, Symbian and Palm. Learn how to use PhoneGap to create platform-neutral mobile applications with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Get the tools and experience you need to build app store ready mobile applications.</p>
