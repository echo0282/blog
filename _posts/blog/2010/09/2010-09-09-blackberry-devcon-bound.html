<p>We’re globetrotting this month, taking PhoneGap to various conferences in Europe and the US. I’m headed to <a href="http://www.blackberrydevcon.com">BlackBerry DEVCON</a> September 27-30 in San Francisco.</p>

<p>BlackBerry DEVCON is a great opportunity to see what’s new with BlackBerry apps and check out some new technologies for the first time. The conference is all about sharpening skills, meeting peers and learning about the latest developer tools, which is why we’ll be showcasing PhoneGap at the conference.</p>

<p>If you want to be there, you can get a $150 discount off the current registration price when you use the code DD6SSC when <a href="http://www.blackberrydevcon.com/register">registering</a>.</p>

<p>Conferences are also a great chance for us to meet more of the PhoneGap developer community. If you’re going to DEVCON, I hope you’ll come say hello. We’ll be demoing PhoneGap at a booth on the showroom floor. Hope to see you there!</p>
