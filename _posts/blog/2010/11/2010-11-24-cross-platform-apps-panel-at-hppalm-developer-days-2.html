<p>Description: Building a mobile app usually involves using one proprietary SDK that targets one platform. This ensures a native look and feel as well as full access to features specific to that device or operating system. Sometimes, however, you don't need full device access. Sometimes you might want to code at a very high level using just web standards and be able to run the application on multiple operating systems. This is similar to coding a mobile website, except that as a local application your app can launch faster, work offline, and have access to local resources. This session presents unique insights into solutions to cross-platform fragmentation</p>
