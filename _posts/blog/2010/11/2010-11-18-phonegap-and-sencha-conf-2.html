<p>This week Andrew Lunny gave an overview of PhoneGap and HTML/JS development for mobile at <a href="http://www.sencha.com/conference/">Sencha Conf</a> in SF. He also gave a sneak peak of some of new feature he's working on in <a href="http://build.phonegap.com">PhoneGap Build</a>. Check out his awesome slide deck:</p>

<p>A bigger theme that people should pay attention to is that PhoneGap plays nicely with almost any HTML/JS library that's optimized for the mobile web, Sencha Touch included. These include jQuery Mobile, Zepto.js, Wink Toolkit, Sproutcore, GloveBox, XUI and more…we're currently tracking them and going put together a page on the <a href="http://wiki.phonegap.com">PhoneGap wiki</a> where we can catalogue and showcase them. Together we can all make better mobile apps and sites with web technologies! So no need for the PhoneGap vs (insert JS lib here) nonsense. Cool. Up up and away!</p>
