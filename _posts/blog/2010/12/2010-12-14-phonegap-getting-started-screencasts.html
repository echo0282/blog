<p>So I have decided to make a series of getting started screencasts helping people setup their environment for developing phonegap apps for specific platforms and making a quick hello world app or loading up the sample app. I was hoping to get some feedback on if you find these screencasts useful, how to improve on them, if you want more and what I should discuss in future screencasts. </p>

<p>I recommend watching these videos in 720p.</p>
