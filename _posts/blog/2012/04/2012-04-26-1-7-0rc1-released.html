<p>We have just released the first release candidate (RC) for <a href="http://phonegap.com/download">PhoneGap 1.7.0</a> and plan on releasing the second RC in the coming days. </p>

<p>This version of PhoneGap is composed mainly of bug fixes from the previous version.</p>

<p>We decided to start issuing release candidates as proper releases in order to have our users report bugs on the latest code base we are working on. If you find any bugs with this version, help out the community and project by reporting them on our <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB">issue tracker</a>. Rest assured, we only tag a release candidate if we are happy with where the code is. </p>

<p>When you click the main download button, you will be downloading 1.7.0rc1. You can download older versions of PhoneGap from <a href="https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap/tags">Github</a>.</p>
