<p>Thank you to everyone who attended <a href="http://pgday.phonegap.com/eu2012/">PhoneGap Day EU</a> and made it such a huge success. Here's the next highlight video for those of you who weren't able to attend.</p>

<p>Our next video is from <a href="http://twitter.com/ianjorgensen">Ian Jorgensen</a> who intrigued the audience with his title "What do Phonegap, Canvas and Urine have in Common?". It turns out that the answer is "Quite a lot!". Ian participated in Health Hackday in Stockholm which is a 24-hour competition to create an app related to healthcare. Ian's talk covers how they used PhoneGap to create <a href="http://www.linehq.com/piddle">Piddle</a>, an app that helps people with urine analysis. </p>

	<p>There are no slides from Ian's presentation but view the recording from PhoneGap Day EU below and check out his app <a href="http://www.linehq.com/piddle">Piddle</a>.</p>
