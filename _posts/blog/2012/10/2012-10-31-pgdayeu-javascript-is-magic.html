<p>Thank you to everyone who attended <a href="http://pgday.phonegap.com/eu2012/">PhoneGap Day EU</a> and made it such a huge success. Here's the next video in our series.</p>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/gordtanner">Gord Tanner</a> talks about <a href="http://ripple.tinyhippos.com/">Ripple</a>, a mobile device emulator for your desktop, that can be installed as a Chrome extension. Ripple was developed by <a href="http://tinyhippos.com/">tinyHippos</a>, a company which was acquired by RIM in 2011. RIM uses Ripple as an emulation environment in the BlackBerry WebWorks SDK, but they've also extended Ripple to support PhoneGap's JavaScript environment along with other JavaScript platforms.
