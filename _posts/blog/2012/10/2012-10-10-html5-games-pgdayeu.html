<p>Thank you to everyone who attended <a href="http://pgday.phonegap.com/eu2012/">PhoneGap Day EU</a> and made it such a huge success. We have decided to highlight each video for those of you who weren't able to attend.</p>

<p>Our third video is from <a href="https://twitter.com/hdragomir">Horia Dragomir</a>, who presented about building games with HTML5 at PhoneGap Day EU. He speaks about the state of HTML5 games and then gives the crowd tons of tips to optimize their applications. You can view the slides from the presentation on <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/u/hdragomir/p/games-apps-and-html5">Speaker Deck</a> and view the recording from PhoneGap Day EU below!</p>
