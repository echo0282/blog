<p>Thank you to everyone who attended <a href="http://pgday.phonegap.com/eu2012/">PhoneGap Day EU</a> and made it such a huge success. We're sharing videos from the event for those of you who weren't able to attend.</p>

<p>Our next video is from <a href="http://twitter.com/rohdef">Rohde Fischer</a>, who presented about working with plugins at PhoneGap Day EU. He speaks about the plugin architecture and how it helped him with his own projects. You can view the slides from the presentation on <a href="https://github.com/rohdef/PGPlugins">Github</a> and view the recording from PhoneGap Day EU below!</p>
