<p>We're proud to announce that yesterday we open sourced the <a href="https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-community">PhoneGap Community Release Notes</a>.</p>

<p>An open source project is only as successful as the community supporting it. PhoneGap is fortunate enough to have an incredible community of people (<em>you</em>) and we take <a href="http://phonegap.com/community/events/">every</a> <a href="http://phonegap.com/case-studies/">opportunity</a> to <a href="http://phonegap.com/apps/">promote</a> and <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/phonegap">help you</a>. In a project release, it's common to include a CHANGELOG that chronicles the fixes, improvements, and features. We think the same should be true for the community activity.</p>

<p>The PhoneGap Community Release Notes are open sourced and for you. We want you to add your blog posts, your friends' blog posts, local events, released apps, and anything else related to PhoneGap. Simply grab a <a href="https://github.com/signup/free">Github account</a> and <a href="https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-community/blob/master/README.md">edit the README</a> using your browser. No Git know-how required. At the end of each month, we'll use the PhoneGap Community Release Notes to publish a <a href="http://phonegap.com/blog/">PhoneGap Blog</a> article that promotes our community's activity.</p>

<p>The notion of community release notes was <a href="http://basho.com/blog/technical/2012/05/09/Riak-Community-Release-Notes/">introduced to us by the Riak project</a>. Immediately, the concept resonated with us and we're happy to have followed in their footsteps. So a huge thanks goes out to the Riak team!</p>
