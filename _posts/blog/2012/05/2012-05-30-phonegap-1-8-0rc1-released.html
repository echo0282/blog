<p>We have just released the first release candidate (RC) for <a href="https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap/zipball/1.8.0rc1">PhoneGap 1.8.0</a>!  This version of PhoneGap is composed mainly of bug fixes from the previous version.</p>

<p>For those of you wanting to be a step ahead, download and run 1.8.0rc1 on your machines. If you find any bugs with this version, help out the community and project by reporting them on our <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB">issue tracker</a>. Rest assured, we only tag a release candidate if we are happy with where the code is.  </p>

<p>We'll continue to provide our latest release, PhoneGap 1.7.0, as the main download in our top nav and stay tuned for the official 1.8.0 release!</p>
