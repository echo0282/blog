<p>A few weeks ago, Sony Ericsson asked <a href="http://digitaldandelion.net">Digital Dandelion</a> to build a mobile application from web-based content using their new <a href="http://developer.sonyericsson.com/site/global/newsandevents/latestnews/newsnov09/p_websdk.jsp">WebSDK</a> and <a href="http://www.phonegap.com">PhoneGap</a>. They built a Google Android app around <a href="http://www.maverickssurf.com/">the Maverick's Surf contest</a>. You can find some screenshots from <a href="http://developer.sonyericsson.com/community/people/sachinanand/blog/tags/mavericks">the app on Sachin's blog</a>.</p>

<p>Jeremiah also put together this great two-minute video talking about using PhoneGap:</p>

<p>You can read the whole story on the Digital Dandelion blog. Here's an excerpt:</p>

<p><em>"PhoneGap allows web apps to be first class citizens on mobile platforms. It does this by running web pages inside of a native application, and providing a javascript bridge library to access device features. When you're done, compile and distribute like any other app."</em></p>
