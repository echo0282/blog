<p>Adobe Developer Evangelist <a href="http://twitter.com/krhoyt">Kevin Hoyt</a> has released new videos covering more PhoneGap APIs. In these step-by-step videos he covers how to use the Connection, Contacts and Device APIs. </p>

<p><em>* PhoneGap: Connection API</em>* - PhoneGapâ€™s Connection API can detect your mobile device's Internet connection. Kevin explains how to use this to your advantage when developing mobile apps. </p>

<p><strong>PhoneGap: Contacts API</strong> - Kevin creates an HTML-based app that can access the contact list on your iOS or Android mobile device.</p>

<p><strong>PhoneGap: Device API</strong> - Kevin employs the Device API in PhoneGap to get more information about the mobile platform on which the application is running.</p>
