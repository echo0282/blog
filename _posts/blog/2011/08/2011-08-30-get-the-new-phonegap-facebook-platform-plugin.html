<p>Today we're launching a new PhoneGap Facebook Platform Plugin. Here's the news:</p>

<p><strong>PhoneGap Facebook Platform Plugin Polishes Log In Experience for Mobile Users</strong></p>

<p><strong>Vancouver, BC—August 30, 2011—</strong>Nitobi Inc., the creators of the popular PhoneGap mobile app development framework, announce today the launch of the PhoneGap Facebook Connect plugin. The new plugin makes it easy for developers building mobile apps with PhoneGap to simplify the log in process for apps that retrieve and use Facebook data.</p>

<p>The Facebook Platform lets users log in to a web page or mobile app using their Facebook login credentials. An example of a popular website that uses this functionality is <em>The New York Times</em>. Users can log in to <em>The New York Times</em> website by signing in to Facebook, after which the application uses Facebook identity data to verify the user.</p>

<p>Facebook provides a JavaScript software development kit (SDK) that makes it possible for web developers to use Facebook Connect. However, the SDK poses a challenge for PhoneGap developers because the Facebook sign on process uses the OAuth 2.0 standard, which doesn't always translate gracefully for their apps.</p>

<p>“We got working on a Facebook plugin because we’re user experience advocates,” said Dave Johnson, CTO at Nitobi Inc. “The OAuth authentication workflow for a mobile app isn’t ideal so we created the PhoneGap Facebook plugin as a way to streamline that process and improve the experience for the end user.”</p>

<p>The plugin uses the same application programming interface (API) as Facebook’s JavaScript SDK. But, instead of replicating the workflow users are accustomed to in desktop web browsers it works with the native Facebook application installed on many iOS and Android smartphones. The end result is a more streamlined and graceful log in experience.</p>

<p>Creating a better user experience was the inspiration for the Facebook plugin, but the PhoneGap community’s enthusiasm for plugins drove the project. “The PhoneGap community is really behind plugins, which is why it was a major focus in the recent PhoneGap 1.0 release. Continuing to improve and expand PhoneGap plugins is a big part of the PhoneGap agenda,” said Brian LeRoux, Senior Vice President of Software Development and Director of Developer Relations at Nitobi, and PhoneGap Evangelist.</p>
