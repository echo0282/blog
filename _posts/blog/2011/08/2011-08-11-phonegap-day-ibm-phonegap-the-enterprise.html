<p>Hey Everyone,</p>

<p>Over the next few weeks, we will be releasing all of the PhoneGap Day talks! The first video I am going to release is a talk by Bryce Curtis from IBM. He talks about IBM, PhoneGap &amp; the Enterprise. You can view his slides at <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/drbac/phonegap-day-ibm-phonegap-and-the-enterprise">http://www.slideshare.net/drbac/phonegap-day-ibm-phonegap-and-the-enterprise</a>. Follow Bryce on twitter at <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/drbac">@drbac</a>.</p>
