<p>Need PhoneGap tech support? Annual support subscriptions are <a href="http://www.phonegap.com/services/#matrix">now available</a> for hackers, development shops and large enterprises.</p>

<p>Till now, PhoneGap app developers have relied on the public <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/phonegap">Google group</a>, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/phonegap">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://wiki.phonegap.com/w/page/16494772/FrontPage">help docs</a> for tech support. Training webinars have also been popular. Though these channels work well for some, the new paid support subscriptions guarantee a higher level of service.</p>

<p>PhoneGap support packages start at $249 and include:</p>

<ul>
<li>A minimum of eight webinars throughout the year.</li>
<li>A private forum.</li>
<li>Nitobi office hours. A day a week, we'll open IRC chat to answer your questions on the spot.</li>
<li>Access to the PhoneGap Build beta.</li>
</ul>

<p>A Pro license costs $5000/year and covers up to five developers on a team. Enterprise licenses are also available.</p>
