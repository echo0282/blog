<p><a href="http://twitter.com/#!/film_girl">Christina Warren</a> just posted a good high level overview of how HTML5 is addressing cross platform dev for devices. </p>

<p>On PhoneGap:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>PhoneGap</strong> is an HTML5 app platform that lets developers build native apps using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. What really sets PhoneGap apart is that it lets developers create a full-functioning mobile web app but place that app in a native wrapper, so that it can use native device APIs and get submitted to the App Store or Android Market.</p>
  
  <p>In essence, it enables mobile developers to create an app just as if they were targeting the mobile browser but with the benefit of being able to get into the App Store.</p>
  
  <p><strong>PhoneGap Build</strong> is a new service (still in beta) that lets developers quickly and easily create app-store ready versions of their apps for various platforms. It does all the work of compiling the code for various platforms and gives the developer a final build suitable for submission to the app market of their choice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't really consider Titanium as an HTML5 solution but it does tackle cross platform dev.</p>
