<p>The guys over at <a href="http://tinyhippos.com/">Tiny Hippos</a> have been kicking ass on their mobile dev emulator <a href="http://ripple.tinyhippos.com/">Ripple</a>. It's a Chrome Extension that helps develop PhoneGap apps by simulating data from <a href="http://docs.phonegap.com">PhoneGap APIs</a>.</p>

<p>Check out this PhoneGap Geo demo in Ripple:</p>
