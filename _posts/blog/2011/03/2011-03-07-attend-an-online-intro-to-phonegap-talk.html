<p>Hey Everyone,</p>

<p>This Tuesday, March 8th at 7:00pm PST,  I am going to be doing a Intro to PhoneGap talk online for a iPhone &amp; Android Dev meetup group in LA. The meetup group is sponsored by <a href="http://www.thebitsource.com">The Bit Source</a>.</p>

<p>The talk will do a basic overview of what PhoneGap is, demo a sample PhoneGap app running on iPhone and Android emulators and do a brief discussion on PhoneGap Build.</p>
