<p>Hey Everyone,</p>

<p>The guys over at <a href="http://www.sproutcore.com/">SproutCore</a> have made a great blog post about how to get people up and running on using SproutCore with PhoneGap. You can check it out at <a href="http://blog.sproutcore.com/sproutcore-and-phonegap/">http://blog.sproutcore.com/sproutcore-and-phonegap/</a>.</p>

<p>SproutCore is a powerful JavaScript framework that is used to build some really slick web applications. It is open source and has a great community behind it. If you haven't checked out SproutCore before, definitely do so. </p>

<p>Let me know what you guys think of the guide and any related comments/suggestions below!</p>

<p>Chow,
